# Find a Legal Adviser

This repository holds the code for the "Find a legal aid adviser or family mediator" application. The service helps members of the public in England and Wales to search for a legal adviser or family mediator with a legal aid contract.

The website address is https://find-legal-advice.justice.gov.uk/.

## Public API

The website uses the LAA Legal Adviser API. The code is hosted at https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-legal-adviser-api.

The REST API is https://prod.laalaa.dsd.io/.

## Dependencies

## Installation for development

### Tips for developing with docker containers

Code editing - You can edit the code on your local disk, with a local editor, as normal. (You don't have to edit the 
files inside the Docker container, because your local directory is mounted into container.) When you save a file, it 
becomes present in the container immediately, and the server restarts.

Browsing the app - Point your local browser at http://localhost:8013/

Log output - watch the output generated by the running app using: `docker logs fala -f` or `docker attach fala`

Please ensure your internet network such as your VPN does not interfere with your build.

To run container:

`./run_local.sh`

This shell script contains commands that build and runs the fala app.

If you're not using `Docker Desktop`, you may want to have two terminals open for the following:

1. To `exec` into the fala docker container.

    `docker exec -it fala bash`

    From the shell inside the container you can run some tests e.g.

    `python manage.py test`

2. Logs and debugging.

    You can see the logging output by attaching to the container:

    `docker attach fala`

    If you added pdb breakpoints, this is where you can interact with this debugger.

Alternatively, some editors have functionality to hook into running containers, such as VS Code's 'Dev Containers' 
extension. Docker Desktop offers a UI version of looking through logs, exec and many other interactions. 

### Debugging
Depending on how you're running the project, via `venv` or Docker you can perform the following debugging:

Add import pdb; pdb.set_trace() as a 'breakpoint' line in the code, where you want to trigger the debugger.

If you're using a docker contain to run your project locally, you can run `docker attach fala` to view the output in 
your chosen terminal.

When pdb.set_trace() is reached, you will be able to debug from the command line.
